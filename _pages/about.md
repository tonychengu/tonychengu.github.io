Hi! I'm Tony, an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm actively seeking internships or Co-op opportunity in **Hardware** or **Data** related fields. My expertise mainly lies in using Python for data analysis employing statistic or ML ideologies. I'm also very interested in IC design and verification and that's why I'm doing another degree at Georgia Tech major in Computer Engineering. I believe my unique interdisciplinary background enables me to understand how data is digested from both hardware and software perspective.

Education Background
======
B.S. Computer Enigneering, Georgia Institute of Technology, May 2025 (expected)  
B.S. Quantitative Science concentration: Informatics, Emory University, May 2023

Research Experience
======
At Emory University, I've been working on machine learning model applied on brain imaging data such as fMRI, sMRI, EGG data with [Prof. Carl Yang](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/), and PhD candidate [Xuan Kan](https://kanxuan.live/) and [Hejie Cui](https://hejiecui.com/).

I'm currently working in the [BioWiNs Lab](https://biowins.ece.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech supervised by Prof. Seun Sangodoyin. I'm working on projects using FPGA for image processing and machine learning.
