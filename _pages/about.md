Purpose Statement
======
Hi! I'm Tony, an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm actively seeking internships or Co-op opportunity in **Hardware** or **Data** related fields.  

Summary
======
My expertise mainly lies in using Python for data analysis employing statistic or ML ideologies. I'm also very interested in IC design and verification and that's why I'm doing another degree at Georgia Tech major in Computer Engineering. I believe my unique interdisciplinary background enables me to understand how data is digested from both hardware and software perspective.  
For more information, you can find my resume [here](http://tonychengu.github.io/files/Antonio Aodong Chen Gu resume.pdf).

Bio
======
B.S. Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, May 2025 (expected)  
B.S. Quantitative Science concentration: Informatics, Emory University, May 2023

Coursework
======
My course work mainly focus on data sciences and computer engineering.  
For data sciences: Regression Analysis, Data Structure and Algorithms (Java), Mach. Learning & Causal Inference (R & Python), Database System (PostgreSQL), Cloud Computing (AWS)  
For computer engineering: Circuit Analysis, Digital System Design, Signal Processing

Skills
======
* **Programming Languages**: Python, C, C++, Verilog, Java, MATLAB, R, SQL, JavaScript, Dart
* **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, ggplot, tidyverse
* **Software**: Git, Linux, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim, Intel Quartus Prime, Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, Autodesk EAGLE, AWS, Flutter, cocotb (for HDL verification automation)

Research Experience
======
At Emory University, I've been working on machine learning model applied on brain imaging data such as fMRI, sMRI, EGG data with [Prof. Carl Yang](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/), and PhD candidate [Xuan Kan](https://kanxuan.live/) and [Hejie Cui](https://hejiecui.com/). During my time at EGM lab, I've developed a deep understanding in MRI imaging data processing pipeline. I've also gained lots of experience in machine learning model development process specifically transformer models.

I'm currently working in the [BioWiNs Lab](https://biowins.ece.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech supervised by Prof. Seun Sangodoyin. I'm working on projects using FPGA for image processing and machine learning.

Career Goals
======
I really like computers and like to learning different specs. Therefore I choose to major in Computer Engineering and hope I can know how computer work and be able to build one myself sometime in the future.
